\section test_ethercat-motorctrl-mode

This test application illustrates usage of Motor Control with Ethercat with advanced 
features

The main application runs 14 threads in total. 2 of these threads are PWM Server and 
Commutation Server responsible for modulation and motor drive. 

Other 2 threads used for position information are Hall Server thread required for BLDC 
motor commutation and QEI Server thread for high precision position information. 
A watchdog server monitors CORE 3 and disables motor in case of emergency. One ADC 
Server thread to capture current in the motor phases. A GPIO Server to monitor the 
digital input switches.

All these 7 threads run on CORE 3 which has physical connection to the interface module (IFM).
Now that we have the interface drive servers setup and running on CORE 3. We can run 
Control Loops like Position/Velocity/Torque Loops on CORE 2/1. 

Another 2 thread run on core 0: one for ethercat communication handling and other one 
for firmware update over ethercat. Since Core 0 has physical connections to the ethercat 
interface and flash spi interface.

Another thread which forms a communication bridge between ethercat and motor drive 
(ecat_motor_drive) runs on core 1. 

More information about Control Server/Client can be found under module_ctrl_loops Readme;
and about ecat_motor_drive under module_ecat_drive
